# Examples using measured data

These examples are meant only for members of the Pierre Auger Collaboration. 
There are three examples:
`window_function_effect-PAOv.ipynb`
`mock_traces_example_PAOv.ipynb`
`calibration_measured_data.ipynb`

The first two just expands already existing examples by adding some comparison made using the data. The last of these three examples shows the real calibration of the RD stations using the FPGA spectra.s
